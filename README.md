# 🚀 Production-Grade AWS Architecture with Terraform

## 📌 Overview

This project provisions a production-style AWS infrastructure using **Terraform**.
It deploys highly available, private EC2 instances behind an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** with **HTTPS termination via AWS ACM**.

The infrastructure is built with security, scalability, and automation principles in mind.

## 🏗 Architecture Summary

The infrastructure includes:

* **VPC** with public and private subnets across 2 Availability Zones
* **Internet Gateway** for inbound traffic
* **NAT Gateway** for outbound internet access from private subnets
* **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** (internet-facing)
* **ACM SSL Certificate** for HTTPS
* **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** in private subnets
* **SSM Session Manager** for secure instance access (no SSH exposure)
* **Terraform Remote Backend (S3 + DynamoDB state locking)**

## 🔐 Security Design Decisions

### 1️⃣ Private EC2 Instances

Application servers are deployed in **private subnets** to prevent direct internet exposure.

### 2️⃣ No SSH Access

No port 22 is exposed. Access is managed using **AWS SSM Session Manager**, reducing attack surface.

### 3️⃣ SSL Termination at ALB

HTTPS is terminated at the ALB using **ACM-managed certificates**, centralizing certificate management.

### 4️⃣ Controlled Inbound Rules

* ALB Security Group allows ports 80 and 443 from the internet.
* EC2 Security Group allows traffic only from ALB Security Group.

---

## 📈 High Availability & Scaling

* Multi-AZ deployment (2 Availability Zones)
* Auto Scaling Group maintains minimum desired capacity
* ALB performs health checks
* Failed instances are automatically replaced

## 🗂 Remote State Management

Terraform state is stored remotely using:

* **S3 Bucket** (state storage)
* **DynamoDB Table** (state locking)

This prevents concurrent state corruption.

## 🗂 Terraform Remote Backend Setup (Required)

This project uses an S3 backend with DynamoDB state locking.

Before running Terraform, create the following resources manually:

### 1️⃣ S3 Bucket (Remote State Storage)

* Region: `ap-south-1`
* Versioning: Enabled
* Block Public Access: Enabled

Example name:

```
my-terraform-state-bucket
```
---

### 2️⃣ DynamoDB Table (State Locking)

* Table name: `terraform-locks`
* Partition key: `LockID` (String)
* Billing mode: On-demand

---

### 3️⃣ Update backend.tf

Update the backend configuration in `backend.tf`:

```
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-state-bucket"
    key            = "production-architecture/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "ap-south-1"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
    encrypt        = true
  }
}
```

---
## 🚀 Deployment

### 1️⃣ Clone Repository

git clone https://github.com/koushikbijili/aws-production-infrastructure-terraform.git
cd aws-production-infrastructure-terraform
cd terraform

### 2️⃣ Configure Remote Backend

Update backend.tf with your S3 bucket and DynamoDB table.

### 3️⃣ Initialize Terraform

terraform init

### 4️⃣ Review Execution Plan

terraform plan

### 5️⃣ Apply Infrastructure

terraform apply


### Access Application

After deployment, retrieve the ALB DNS:

```
terraform output alb_dns_name
```

Example:

```
https://example.com
```

## 🧪 Testing

* Confirm ALB listener on ports 80 and 443

## 💰 Cost Awareness

This infrastructure includes:

* NAT Gateway
* Application Load Balancer
* EC2 Instances

Destroy resources after testing:

```
terraform destroy
```

---

## 📚 Key Learnings

* Production-grade VPC design
* Multi-AZ architecture
* ALB integration with ASG
* ACM certificate management
* Secure access using SSM
* Remote state locking in Terraform

---

# 🔥 Now Important — Update ACM in Code

Inside `acm.tf`, change:

```
domain_name = "example.com"
subject_alternative_names = ["www.example.com"]
```

Instead of your real domain.

```
# Replace example.com with your own domain
```
